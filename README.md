# Excipient-Optimisation
Freely available supporting information used in the production of MD trajectories of protein-excipient interaction, and the analysis thereof.
This repository contains template scripts used in the generation and analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories. Specifically, they have been used in a study investigating the interaction between human serum albumin and various formulation excipients.
It contains bash scripts for use with Gromacs, as well as R code to extract and present useful information.
